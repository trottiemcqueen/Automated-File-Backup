# Automated-File-Backup
Created a useful tool that assist with day to day work and projects. I believe it's the responsible thing to do.

## Function of the Program
created program to backup downloads to a desktop folder at a scheduled time every week
and also a way to save memory if I chose to clear the downloads in my OS, I would still have
a backup folder on my desktop. I figured, it's a risk worth trying out.
